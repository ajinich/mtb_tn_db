PpsA can accept as substrate the activated forms of either icosanoyl (C20), docosanoyl (C22) or lignoceroyl (C24) groups from FadD26, or a (4-hydroxyphenyl)-C17 or (4-hydroxyphenyl)-C19 fatty acyl from FadD29 (PubMed:15749014, PubMed:20553505). PpsA initiates the biosynthesis and extends its substrate using a malonyl-CoA extender unit. The PpsB and PpsC proteins add the second and third malonyl-CoA extender units. PpsD adds an (R)-methylmalonyl unit and PpsE adds a second (R)-methylmalonyl unit.

Acts as a phosphatase that dephosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P), a membrane trafficking regulatory lipid essential for phagosomal acquisition of lysosomal constituents (PubMed:15753315). Therefore, SapM eliminates PI3P from the phagosomal membrane by catalyzing its hydrolysis, and thus contributes to inhibition of phagosome maturation (PubMed:15753315). Also interferes with autophagy: SapM blocks autophagosome-lysosome fusion in macrophages by binding to the small GTPase RAB7, which prevents RAB7 from being involved in this process and thus negatively regulates autophagy flux (PubMed:25896765). In vitro, displays phosphatase activity with broad specificity; can dephosphorylate a variety of phosphoester substrates, with the highest activity against phosphoenolpyruvate, glycerophosphate, GTP, NADPH, phosphotyrosine and trehalose-6-phosphate (PubMed:11073936).

PpsA can accept as substrate the activated forms of either icosanoyl (C20), docosanoyl (C22) or lignoceroyl (C24) groups from FadD26, or a (4-hydroxyphenyl)-C17 or (4-hydroxyphenyl)-C19 fatty acyl from FadD29 (PubMed:15749014, PubMed:20553505). PpsA initiates the biosynthesis and extends its substrate using a malonyl-CoA extender unit. The PpsB and PpsC proteins add the second and third malonyl-CoA extender units. PpsD adds an (R)-methylmalonyl unit and PpsE adds a second (R)-methylmalonyl unit.

It specifically interacts with HSP90, HSP70 and HSP27 that block apoptotic pathways but not with other HSPs. Also interacts with GAPDH. It actively dephosphorylates MAP kinase p38 and NF-kappa B p65 (specifically at Ser-536) that play crucial roles in inflammatory and immune responses. This in turn leads to down-regulation of Interleukin 8, a chemotactic and inflammatory cytokine. Thus might help the pathogen to evade the host's immune response (PubMed:26984196). Exogenous addition of purified SerB2 protein to human THP-1 cells (that can be differentiated into macrophage-like cells) induces microtubule rearrangements; the phosphatase activity is co-related to the elicited rearrangements, while addition of the ACT-domains alone elicits no rearrangements (PubMed:25521849). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:25521849, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26984196}.",Rv3042c,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Thus, displays KGD activity, catalyzing the decarboxylation from five-carbon 2-oxoglutarate to four-carbon succinate semialdehyde (SSA). Also catalyzes C-C bond formation between the activated aldehyde formed after decarboxylation of alpha-ketoglutarate and the carbonyl of glyoxylate (GLX), to yield 2-hydroxy-3-oxoadipate (HOA), which spontaneously decarboxylates to form 5-hydroxylevulinate (HLA). And is also a component of the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (ODH) complex, that catalyzes the overall conversion of 2-oxoglutarate to succinyl-CoA and CO(2). The KG decarboxylase and KG dehydrogenase reactions provide two alternative, tightly regulated, pathways connecting the oxidative and reductive branches of the TCA cycle, which can endow M.tuberculosis with the metabolic plasticity required for growth on diverse host-derived carbon sources. Appears to play a predominant role in growth on carbohydrates as the sole carbon source, and only a minimal role during growth on fatty acids. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16027371, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19936047, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20416504, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21867916}.",Rv1248c,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Catalyzes the F420H(2)-dependent two-electron reduction of quinones to dihydroquinones, thereby preventing the formation of cytotoxic semiquinones obtained by the one-electron reduction pathway (PubMed:23240649). In vitro, catalyzes the reduction of both benzoquinone and naphthoquinone analogs; since menaquinone is the sole quinone electron carrier in the respiratory chain in M.tuberculosis, the physiological electron acceptor for Fqr-mediated F420H(2) oxidation is therefore likely to be the endogenous menaquinone found in the membrane fraction of M.tuberculosis (PubMed:23240649). Is able to use F420 species with two and five glutamate residues in its polyglutamate tail (PubMed:22023140). Cannot use NADH or NADPH instead of F420H(2) as the electron donor (PubMed:23240649). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:22023140, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23240649}.; FUNCTION: Is involved in the bioreductive activation of bicyclic 4-nitroimidazole prodrugs such as PA-824 and delamanid developed for anti-tuberculosis therapy against both replicating and persistent bacteria. It converts PA-824 into three primary metabolites resulting from reduction of the imidazole ring at C-3; the major one is the corresponding des-nitroimidazole that generates lethal reactive nitrogen species, including nitric oxide (NO), which appears to be responsible for the anaerobic killing activity. Ddn uses the reduced F420 produced by FGD1 to activate PA-824. Delamanid (OPC-67683) is also reduced by Ddn to its des-nitro form. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16387854, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19039139, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22023140, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22244759}.",Rv3547,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Acts as an acetyltransferase. Acetylates 'Lys-55' of dual-specificity protein phosphatase 16 (DUSP16)/mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-7 (MKP-7), a JNK-specific phosphatase; this leads to the inhibition of JNK-dependent autophagy, phagosome maturation, and ROS (reactive oxygen species) generation for enhanced intracellular survival of M.tuberculosis (PubMed:22547814). Inhibits Con A-mediated T-cell proliferation in vitro (PubMed:17449476). Treatment of T-cells with Eis inhibits ERK1/2, JAK pathway, and subsequent production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-4 (IL-4); on the contrary, there is increased production of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin-10 (IL-10), which indicates that immunity in response to Eis treatment is skewed away from a protective T(H)1 response and Eis disturbs the cross regulation of T-cells (PubMed:17449476). When expressed in M.smegmatis, enhances intracellular survival of the bacteria in host macrophages during infection (PubMed:10629183). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10629183, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17259625, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17449476, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21187903, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22547814}.; FUNCTION: Can also acetylate multiple amine groups of many aminoglycoside (AG) antibiotics, leading to their inactivation, and thus contributes to drug resistance (PubMed:19906990, PubMed:21628583, PubMed:24106131). Is also able to acetylate and deactivate the cyclic peptide antibiotic capreomycin, but not the other anti-tuberculous drugs isoniazid and pyrazinamide (PubMed:23233486). Acetylates kanamycin (KAN) more efficiently than amikacin (AMK), even though Eis seems to bind AMK with higher affinity (PubMed:19906990).

To a lesser extent, is also able to hydrolyze inositol 1-phosphate (I-1-P), fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) (to fructose 6-phosphate (F-6-P)) and AMP in vitro, but this might not be significant in vivo. Glucose-1-phosphate (G-1-P), p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP), and beta-glycerol phosphate (beta-GP) are also good substrates, compared to I-1-P. With much lower efficiency, can also hydrolyze inositol 2-phosphate (I-2-P) and glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P) in vitro, but not fructose-6-phosphate (F-6-P) and trehalose-6-phosphate (T-6-P). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16325768, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18454554}.",Rv2131c,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Thus, catalyzes the oxidation of the antitubercular pro-drug ethionamide (ETH) to the corresponding sulfoxide, which is further oxidized by EthA to 2-ethyl-4-amidopyridine, presumably via the unstable doubly oxidized sulfinic acid intermediate; the final metabolite 2-ethyl-4-amidopyridine has no antitubercular activity, so the cytotoxic species is a metabolite intermediate formed by EthA. Also oxidizes thiacetazone (TAC), thiobenzamide, and isothionicotinamide and therefore is probably responsible, as suggested by the observation of crossover resistance, for the oxidative activation of these other thioamide antitubercular drugs. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10869356, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10944230, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11823459, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14610090}.",Rv3854c,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Affects the phagocytosis process by preventing phagosome acidification and maturation in the macrophage (PubMed:22087003, PubMed:16085396, PubMed:18474358). This inhibition depends on both PtpA phosphatase activity and its ability to bind to host vacuolar-H(+)-ATPase (V-ATPase) machinery (PubMed:22087003). Enters into the host cytosol and binds to subunit H of the human V-ATPase machinery to block V-ATPase trafficking and phagosome acidification (PubMed:22087003). Dephosphorylates and inactivates host VPS33B protein, which inhibits phagosome maturation, fusion with the lysosome and promotes bacteria survival (PubMed:18474358, PubMed:22087003). Dephosphorylation of VPS33B requires interaction of PtpA with host V-ATPase and ubiquitin (PubMed:22087003, PubMed:25642820). Binding to host ubiquitin also leads to the dephosphorylation of phosphorylated Jnk and MAPK p38, leading to suppression of innate immunity (PubMed:25642820). Dephosphorylates host GSK-3 alpha on Tyr-279, which leads to modulation of GSK-3 alpha anti-apoptotic activity, promoting pathogen survival early during infection (PubMed:25187516). In vitro, dephosphorylates two subunits of the trifunctional enzyme TFP (ECHA/ ECHB), which means that it may also affect pathways involved in cell energy metabolism (PubMed:25743628). Furthermore, blocks innate immune system responses mediated by the host adapter TAB3 and dependent on NF-kappa-B by competitively binding the ubiquitin-interacting domain of TAB3, in a phosphatase activity-independent manner (PubMed:25642820). Antagonizes TRIM27-promoted JNK/p38 MAPK pathway activation and cell apoptosis through competitively binding to the RING domain of TRIM27 (PubMed:27698396). In addition, PtpA enters the nucleus of host cells and regulates the expression of several host genes, some of which are known to be involved in host innate immunity or in cell proliferation and migration, either by directly binding to the promoters of its target genes, or in an indirect manner (PubMed:28811474). In vitro, can bind directly to the promoter region of GADD45A, a gene encoding a protein involved in cell division, cell death and senescence, and DNA-damage repair (PubMed:28811474). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16085396, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18474358, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22087003, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25187516, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25642820, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25743628, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27698396, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28811474}.",Rv2234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
